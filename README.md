**MFL TICKETING SYSTEM**

The Malaysian Football League (MFL) Ticketing System is a web-based application built using PHP, JavaScript, and CSS without any frameworks. It offers a seamless ticket-buying experience for football fans. The system includes three user roles:

Customer: Purchase tickets, review order history, and update personal information.
Admin: Manage ticket requests, update ticket details, modify standings, and review sales data.
Football Association: Submit ticket requests for home matches and manage ticket sales for their fixtures.

This project simplifies the ticketing process, making it easier for fans and providing the league with efficient management tools.

Note: Please enable PHP GD extension inside php.ini to make the pdf module works.
